# Pokémon Top Trumps
This is a plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project spun off one of the early School of Code to learn the basics of  manipulating the DOM and API requests.

## Features

## Demo


## API
**[PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/):** All the Pokémon data you'll ever need in one place,
easily accessible through a modern RESTful API ([Documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)).

## Lessons Learned
- In the initial bootcamp version of this project, we didn't include any error handling. I learnt to handle errors before you convert from json, else the code breaks.

- A reminder of how the callstack works when using async / await, as I initially had a few problems getting the cards to display the pokemon stats, since the display functions were being called before the promise had resolved.

## Future Improvements
- Improve the responsiveness of the page; everything gets very tiny on mobiles!
- Deal the player a random selection of pokemon, instead of making them choose one at a time.
- Use modals instead of alert boxes
