# Pokémon Top Trumps
This is a plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript project spun off one of the early School of Code to learn the basics of working with APIs.

## Demo

# Lessons Learned
In the initial bootcamp version of this project, we didn't include any error handling. 

- Handle errors before you convert from json, else the code breaks first
